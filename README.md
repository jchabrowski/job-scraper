# job-scraper

## ðŸš€ About
job-scraper is a small proof-of-concept project that scrapes job listing data and extracts it into a local PocketBase database.

## ðŸš€ Project goal
Play around with python, web scraping, selenium and pocketbase. Collect job listing data.

## Can this project be cloned and run locally?
Not right now. All the XPaths that locate DOM elements are stored in a .env file, which is not included in the repository to prevent potential spamming of job boards.
